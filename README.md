CONTACT LIST

Let's build a contact list!
Using the images below as a template/guide - build a simple contact list
On your "home" view, show a list of all of the users in your user array.
When I click on any of the users, I'm routed to a view with that user's info.
There should be a back button or icon to take me back to the home (list) view.
The URL should also change to reflect the current resource I'm viewing.
